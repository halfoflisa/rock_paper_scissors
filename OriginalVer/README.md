Assignment:
1. Make a simple implementation of "rock paper scissors".
2. Create a blank HTML document with a script tag. This game is going to be played completely from the console.
3. Begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. 
4. Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters, "playerSelection" and "computerSelection". Then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
    1. Make your function case insensitive (so users can input rock, ROCK, RocK or any other variation).
5. Write a NEW function called game(). Use the previous function inside of this one to play a 5 round game that keeps score and reports a winner or loser at the end.
    1. At this point you should be using console.log() to display the results of each round and the winner at the end.
    2. Use prompt() to get input from the user.
